        <h1>Section 2: JavaScript Language Basics</h1>
        <h3>What is Javascript?</h3>
        <p>Javascript is lightweight, cross-platform, object-oriented computer programming language.
            It is one of the three core technologies of web development. Today, it can be used in different places:
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side: JavaScript was traditionally only used in the browser.</li>
                <li>Server-side: Thanks to node.js, we can use JavaScript on the server as well.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
